Before we look at manipulating files it is a good idea to learn how to locate them on a resource.  Files are stored in directories (sometimes also referred to as folders) on volumes typically assigned drive letters, at least in the world of Windows.  The Directory class is a static class that contains many methods for interrogating and manipulating directories.  Most file access methods require elevated privileges so if the user executing a program cannot perform certain operations directly in Windows Explorer then the equivalent C# methods would also likely fail.
