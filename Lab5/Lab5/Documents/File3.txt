Files are the named blocks of data that reside on a file system and represent persistent data.  This differs from variables which are volatile and stored in temporary memory RAM.  A file can contain either text or binary data.  A text data file is just as it sounds - a file filled with text.  However, there are many different ways to encode text, such as: ASCII, UTF-8 and UTF-16.  We'll look at text encoding a bit later.  Binary data files, on the other hand, can contain any data such as images or videos and even text, and are essentially byte arrays stored on some medium.  Files of either type are limited in size by the operating system, the file system and the hardware.  Current limits in Windows 10 using NTFS New Technology File System restrict files to 256 TiB of data, but you'll likely never directly work with files that large unless you are dealing with VERY large databases.
